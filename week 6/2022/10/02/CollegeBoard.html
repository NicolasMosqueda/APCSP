<h1 id="reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection</h1>

<p>These were very informative questions. It gave me an idea of what to expect on the AP exam. There were certain things that were a bit confusing that I should be sure to review more. A question I have is: What are future tpics that will be crucial to understand?</p>

<h1 id="unit-11-collaboration-notes">
<a class="anchor" href="#unit-11-collaboration-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unit 1.1 Collaboration Notes</h1>

<p>Leanring Objective: Explain how computing innovtions are improved through collaboration</p>

<p>-Benefits of collaborating: Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it</p>

<p>-There are many interpersonal skills that can be learned through collaboration such as: Communication, Consensus Building, Conflict Resolution, and Negotiation</p>

<p>-Pair Programming:Two programmers work together as a pair and while one codes, the other reviews and observes</p>

<p>-Think-Pair-Share: Students think through a problem alone then share ideas with partner and then whole class</p>

<p>Learning Objective: Describe the purpose of a computing innovation</p>

<p>-The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue intersts through creative expressions</p>

<p>-An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation</p>

<p>Leanring Objectives:Identify inputs to a program and identify outputs produced by a program</p>

<p>-Program inputs are data sent to as computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</p>

<p>-An event is asscoiated with an action and supplies input data to a program</p>

<p>-Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution</p>

<p>-Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program</p>

<p>-In event driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered, rather than through the sequential flow of control</p>

<p>-Input can come from a user of other programs</p>

<p>-Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</p>

<p>Learning Objective: Explain how a prgram or code segment functions</p>

<p>-A program is a collection of program statements that perfrom a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often reffered to as software</p>

<p>-A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program</p>

<p>-A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations</p>

<p>-The behavior or a program functions during the execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it</p>

<p>-A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function</p>

<h1 id="unit-13-program-design-and-development-notes">
<a class="anchor" href="#unit-13-program-design-and-development-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unit 1.3 Program, Design, and Development Notes</h1>

<p>Learning Objective: Develop a program using a development process and design aprogram and its user interface</p>

<p>-A development process can be oriented and intentional or exploratory in nature</p>

<p>-There are multiple development processes, such as:investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing</p>

<p>Learning Objective: Ackknowledge code segments used from other sources</p>

<p>-It is important ot acknowledge any code segements that were developed collaboratively or by another source</p>

<p>-Acknowledgement of a code segment written by someone else and used in a program can be in program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the orgin or original authors name</p>

<p>Learning Objective: Descirbe the purpose of a code segement or program by writing documentation</p>

<p>-Program documentation is a written description of the function of a cod segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed</p>

<p>-Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs</p>

<p>-Programmers should document a program throughout its development</p>
