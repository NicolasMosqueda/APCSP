            "content": "console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Nicolas&quot;); . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Anthony&quot;, &quot;tonyhieu&quot;, 2022), new Person(&quot;Bria&quot;, &quot;B-G101&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Allie&quot;, &quot;xiaoa0&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Tigran&quot;, &quot;Tigran7&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Rebecca-123&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Vidhi&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, 2024) ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Group Group.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Age&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;classOf&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.group for (var row of compsci.group) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.age + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .",

            "content": "Focus and Habits . Nicolas Mosqueda . In the video “Psychology and the Good Life” by Laurie Santos I was able to learn about on how to imporve my quality of life and just how to become happier overall. The main takeaways I got from the video was the importance of expressing gratitude and helping others. . Expressing Gratitude: Santos stressed the importance of being grateful for all the great things we have in life. She explained how doing has proven to make people happier through several studies. I can incorporate this into my life my sitting down for 20 minutes with no distractions and wrting out all the things I am grateful for. . Helping Others: Santos described an experiement in which peolpe were given 5 dollars and some kept the money and spent on themselves while others gave it to others. It was found that the ones who gave the money away were signifianclty more satisfied. This shows that in helping others you are infireclty helping your own happiness. I can incorporate this in my life by making sure to do a random act of kindness week such as giving a homeless person money. . Ben Lee . Laurie Santos gave me lots of insight on how to improve my daily life in the video “Psychology and the Good Life”. Some of the ideas that I think will be the most helpful for me are making time for things other than work and importance of getting proper sleep. . Making time: Santo speaks on how nowadays peolpe get so caught up in work that they dont spend time doing anything else. She explained how this is very bad for our health and we need to make time for other things. I can incorporate this in my life my setting a schedule every week for when I will hangout with my firends and go to the gym so I dont end up spending my entire day doing homework. . Sleep: Santos talked about the importance of sleep and how a lack of sleep can greatly affect a persons happiness. She mentioned a statistic of highschool students getting an average of around 4 hours of sleep per night which is far from the recommneded 8 hours. I can ensure that I get a good nights sleep every night by setting an alarm on my phone to go to bed at a certain time everynight. . .",

In order to do this I need to pause myself when I find myself typing code that I do not really understand. As Bria stated, I can take notes on college board videos and if I need more additional help I can watch Khan Academy as there tons of additional information there . Data Abstraction . It willbe crucial that I spend lots of time on this project and give my best effort so that I have the 2 code segments done to the best of my ability. It is important that my code runs smoothly with no falws . Managing Complexity and Procedural Abstraction . I need to start getting in the habit of not doing the bare minimum when I code. I tend to doubt myslef becasue I am not an experienced coder, but I need to go out of my comfort zone and start experiemnting with more advanced code. I can start by aiming for 3/3 on the weekly grading instead of just getting 2.7/3 . Algorithm Implementation . I need to learn how to be more efficient in my code. Doing this will make me better at learning how to use algorithm so I make the computer do more of the work for me. . Testing . I can practice for this point by starting to make posts explaing my code and what it does. Doing this will make explanations of code for clear so that the person grading my assignmnet can see that I know what i am talking about. . Possible Ideas . I am still unsure of what my project will be, but I am thinking of making a game which challenges the user in a way through questionare, and is also educational. .",

I want the quiz to tell you if you go the question right or wrong immeediately after the question and then give your score as a percentage at the end. . Successes . I was able to make the a working quiz where there was instant feedback after every question on whether the user got hte question right or wrong. Additoinally, the 3 questions ran smoothly and was able to allow the user to retake the questions as many times as desired . Challenges . Some challenegs I ran into was not being able to make the quiz display the score at the end. This was the one thign I was not able to do that was apart of my original plan. I also ran into troubles while making the quiz such as having buttons lead to the wrong the screen. I got stuck fo a little bit when I did not realize that I forgot to include quotation marks for oone of the variables which did not allow the quiz to run. . Discoveries .

            "content": "Computer Science EC Event Reflection . During the event today, I was able to gain lots of insight on college and careers in general from the six wonderful speakers. I was able to learn many new things that will definitely help me in my future. I am very grateful that the students were able to take time out of their schedule to share their personal experiences in order to help us. . There were many key takeaways from the students talk. A commonality I found with all of the students was that taking Computer Science was a very interesting experience and it was great in building a strong programming foundation. As they also mentioned that even if you do not decide to major in computer science, the skills learned in the class will still be very helpful for the majority of other majors. For example, one of the students mentioned that on a project for college, his background in computer science helped him save lots of time as he could create a script rather than doing a bunch of manual work. I found all of this very interesting as it made me glad that I took this class as I know that will likely benefit me at some point in my future. This also motivated me to make the most out of this class and try to learn everything that I possibly can. . Another thing that was very helpful was the reassurance that I was given by the students. They mentioned how the computer science space is very competitive and it can be discouraging. They advised to focus on your own path and not worry about what others are doing. I found this very relatable as in the first couple weeks of this computer science class it has become clear that many students are way more experienced than others. Being someone who is very inexperienced, I found this very comforting. I know that if I put in my best effort, everything will work out in the end. . In terms of career and college advice, they said many things I will apply to my future. For example, they talked about making connections and building up your background through different jobs and internships. They largely expressed the importance of building connections and reaching out to people who are in the same field as you. As well as making a Linkedin or Resume to record different jobs or projects that you have worked on. I will make sure that I start doing all of these things to prepare me for my future. I want to be fully prepared for the real world once I leave high school and head on to college and beyond. .",
