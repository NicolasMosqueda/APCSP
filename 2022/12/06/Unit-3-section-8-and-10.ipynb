    "The question confused me at first as I thought the answer was WHILE loop. My thinking was that a while loop continues to repeat until a condition is met, which in this case was when the user inputs 'quit'. The right answer is FOR loop because when iterating over a list it will continue to repeat unitl the user quits. While loop is more appropriate for conditional statements."
