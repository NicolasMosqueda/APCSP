<p>Overall I think I did a good job scoring the exampe submissions. I did get alittle bit better at grading the third row whihc is about managing complexity. I think all 4 examples were quite good, with the second one being very good, I will use that as a guide when making my own project. I definitely find myself getting better at grading these and it hopefully translate to me performing better on my performance task.</p>
