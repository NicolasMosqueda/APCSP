<p>Overall I think I did a good job scoring the exampe submissions.I made 4 errors last time and only 3 this time so I am improving each timr.. The first 2 submissions were not very good, however the third and foruth submissions were very strong and I will use that as a guide when making my own project. I definitely find myself getting better at grading these and it hopefully translate to me performing better on my performance task.</p>
