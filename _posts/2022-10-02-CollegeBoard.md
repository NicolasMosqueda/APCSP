# College Board Quiz

# Reflection

These were very informative questions. It gave me an idea of what to expect on the AP exam. There were certain things that were a bit confusing that I should be sure to review more. A question I have is: What are future tpics that will be crucial to understand?

# Unit 1.1 Collaboration Notes

Leanring Objective: Explain how computing innovtions are improved through collaboration

-Benefits of collaborating: Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it

-There are many interpersonal skills that can be learned through collaboration such as: Communication, Consensus Building, Conflict Resolution, and Negotiation

-Pair Programming:Two programmers work together as a pair and while one codes, the other reviews and observes

-Think-Pair-Share: Students think through a problem alone then share ideas with partner and then whole class

# Unit 1.2 Program, Function, and Purpose Notes

Learning Objective: Describe the purpose of a computing innovation

-The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue intersts through creative expressions

-An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation

Leanring Objectives:Identify inputs to a program and identify outputs produced by a program

-Program inputs are data sent to as computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text

-An event is asscoiated with an action and supplies input data to a program

-Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution

-Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program

-In event driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered, rather than through the sequential flow of control

-Input can come from a user of other programs

-Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text

Learning Objective: Explain how a prgram or code segment functions

-A program is a collection of program statements that perfrom a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often reffered to as software

-A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program

-A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations

-The behavior or a program functions during the execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it

-A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function

# Unit 1.3 Program, Design, and Development Notes

Learning Objective: Develop a program using a development process and design aprogram and its user interface

-A development process can be oriented and intentional or exploratory in nature

-There are multiple development processes, such as:investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing

Learning Objective: Ackknowledge code segments used from other sources

-It is important ot acknowledge any code segements that were developed collaboratively or by another source

-Acknowledgement of a code segment written by someone else and used in a program can be in program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the orgin or original authors name

Learning Objective: Descirbe the purpose of a code segement or program by writing documentation

-Program documentation is a written description of the function of a cod segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed

-Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs

-Programmers should document a program throughout its development
