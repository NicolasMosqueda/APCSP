# Corrections

Question 4: Correct answer is C. Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.

Question 11: Correct Answer is A.The binary number 11110000 is equal to 27+26+25+24, or 240. Therefore, the given binary triplet represents the color ivory.

Question 15: Correct Answer is A.  Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed

Question 24: Correct Answer is B. The value of val starts at 0 and is repeatedly incremented by 2, so the program calculates the sum of even integers. Inside the loop, val is incremented by 2 before being added to sum, so the first value added to sum is 2. The loop iterates 10 times, adding each intermediate value of val each time.

Question 30: Correct Answer is D. The string "out of range" could only be displayed if the condition n ≥ 1 was false. If the initial value of n is at least 0, then n will be incremented by 1, making n at least 1. Therefore the condition n ≥ 1 will be true and "out of range" will not be displayed. If the initial value of n is negative, then n will be multiplied by -1, making n at least 1

Question 38: The correcct answer is B.  IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected.

Question 46: The correct answer is A. Every device connected to the Internet is assigned an IP address, which is used to enable communication using the Internet protocol.

Question 52: The correct answer is A. Statement I is true. The REPEAT UNTIL loop terminates when hours is at least 24 or currentPop is at most 0. Statements II and III are false. The simulation displays the change in population over the entire course of the simulation.

Question 61: The correct asnwer is B. Providing accessibility features may allow some groups to access technology and content that they previously could not access.

Question 66: The correct asnwer is C. This line should be removed. Every integer from start to end should be checked, so currentNum should only be incremented inside the loop but outside the body of the IF statement.
