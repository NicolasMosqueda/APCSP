# Big Idea 5.3

As programmers, you now have the possibility of creating algorithms. It has been said, “Humans are error-prone and biased”. So, does that mean algorithms and the computers they run on are better?

Algorithms and computers are not neccesarily better or worse than humans. They can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately. However,algorithms can also reflect the biases and errors present in the data they are trained on and the humans who created them. 

Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

An older age group uses Facebook while a younger age group uses tik tok. I think this is some wha purposeful to the colors used on the platforms and the fact that the look of tik tok is much more appealing to a younger audience. I dont think this is neccessarily harmful becasue nobody is restricted from using the platforms.

Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

Virtual assisstants likely have female voices becasue they are more soothing, therefore, i think this is purposeful. A female voive also represents a mother like figure

Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)

Algotrithms work off the things you intereact with and recommends you media that is related that the computer thinks you will also enjoy

Video:
In the video the computer only recognizes the white person becasue when training the computer most of the test subjects were likely white. Additionally, the lighting in the room likely made it harder for the computer to capture the facial features of the black person. This could be harmful as people of color will probably feel left out. This could be fixed by giving the computer further training with people of color used as test subjects.

Discuss APIs you have used:

During the first trimester my group used a marvel api to get data about all marvel characters in the marel database. We used this to make a marvel searchbar that the user could use to learn about whtaever marvel character they wanted.

What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?

The biggest discovery I have found on Github are many different features that help with our learning in this class. Such as the baility to make issues to track our progress and the insights feature to see how much work we have been doing.


CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

A possible crowdsource idea is to make some sort of coding challenege and students could submit there response to the challenges. At the end the responses of all the students could be shared for others to look at to furhter there learning

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?

Our project could be better wuth crowdsourcing as we can ask for feedback from many Del Norte students n how we could imporve our project. They could also help us come up with ideas

What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.

Data that we could capture at N@tM is getting feedback from the guests and noting down any recommendations. We can use this data to make the following N@tM more interesting for the guests
