# Submission 1 

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows a running program and response gives a good description of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | includes 2 program segments, one showing how data is stored and the other showing how data is being used- The first segment shows data being stored in the identified list, but the second segment does not show data being accessed from the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | does not explain how the code managaes complexity  |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | does not explain how procedure contributes ot overall functionality of the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Submission 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows a running program and response gives a good description of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | includes two program code segment,one that shows how data has been stored in a list and one that shows the data in a list being used |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | has a program code segment that includes a list and explains how the list manages complexity |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what each of the segment does |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Submission 3

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows a running program and response gives a good description of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | there is no code that shows data veing used from the list|
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | does not explain how the code managaes complexity  |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | does not properly explain how procedure contributes ot overall functionality of the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | the student developed algorithm does not include iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 0 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure - The response describes two calls from the specified procedure, rather than two calls to the
specified procedure. |

# Submission 4

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows a running program and response gives a good description of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | includes two program code segment,one that shows how data has been stored in a list and one that shows the data in a list being used |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | has a program code segment that includes a list and explains how the list manages complexity |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what each of the segment does |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 0 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure - The response does not describe specific arguments that are passed through the parameters.
Rather the response explains the alternate coding segments if they were used.|


# Summary

Overall I think I did a good job scoring the exampe submissions.I made 4 errors last time and only 3 this time so I am improving each timr.. The first 2 submissions were not very good, however the third and foruth submissions were very strong and I will use that as a guide when making my own project. I definitely find myself getting better at grading these and it hopefully translate to me performing better on my performance task.
