# AP Classroom 4.1 Notes

Learning Objective: Explain how computing devices work tgether in a network

-a computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors

-a computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose

-a computer network is a group of interconnected computing device capable of sending or recieving data

-a computer network is a type of computing system

-a path between two computing devices on a computer network is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver

-routing is the process of finding a path from the sender to receiver

-the bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time

-bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second

Learning Objective:Explain how the internet works, explain how data are sent through the internet via packets, describe the differences between the Internet and thwe World Wide Web

-the internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open communication protocols

-access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device

-a protocol is an agreed upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system

-the protocols used in the internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet

-routing on the internet is usually dynamic, it is not specified in advance

-the scalability of a system is the cappacity for the sytem to change in size and scale to meet new demands

-the internet was designed to be scalable
