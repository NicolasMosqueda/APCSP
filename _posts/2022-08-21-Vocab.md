| Vocab      | Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Sequence | multiple steps or lines of code, must be more than one |
| Repositry | A repositroy is a place or source where code is stored |
| Clone | Cloning code means transferring code from one place to another |
| Python | Python is one of the biggest computer programming languages |
| Jupyter Notebook | Meant for Python users in order to complete web server completed tasks |
| Scrum Master | The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. |
| DevOps | DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies (requirements.txt), AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. |
| Frontend Developer | A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. |
| Backend Developer | Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. |
| J.son | text-based way of representing JavaScript object literals, arrays, and scalar data |
| Agile | Practices like pair programming, planning sessions, sprints… |
| Arrays | Stores collection of multiple items under single variable name |
| Iteration | Repitition of a Process |
| For Loop | repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated |
| While Loop | used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met |
| Initialization | What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. |
| Condition | Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. |
| increment/decrement | Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. |
| Indexing / List Index | The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 |
| append, remove, pop | Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. |
| Elements [in a list] | An item in a list. |
| Nesting | Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. |
| array | Another name for a list, depends on the language |
| list | a sequence of several variables grouped together |
| variable | a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used |
| data types | a set of values and operations on those values |
| abstract data types | a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client |
| client | a program that uses a data type |
| objects | a structure that can take on a data-type value |
| Applications programming interface (API) | which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type |
