# Correction

For this problem I answered [-3, -2, -1] which was the incorrect answer. The correct asnwer is [-1, 0, 1]. The reason why is the computer flips the sign of all the integers until they are all positive. For the answer I chose, all the negative numbers are negative so when the sign is flipped they all become positve so the procedure is able to work. [-1, 0, 1] does not work since there is both a negative numer and positive number so matter how may times you flip the signs one of the numbers will always be negative. Therefore, the procedure will not produce the intended result.
