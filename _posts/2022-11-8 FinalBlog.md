# Final Score

![Final Score](![CB Q14](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TUDAF53UJ-F049M8F4S7R/image.png))

# Question 14

![CB Q14](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TUDAF53UJ-F049M8F4S7R/image.png)

When answering the question I slected 7 as an answer becasue I did not realize that the first line of code says that numcorrect is greater than 7 and I interpreted as greater or equal to 7. I now know that a 7 would result in a check which is correct. The answer 6 is correct because since it is less than 7 the code will display a check which is not correct as it shoud display a check minus.

# Question 20

![CB Q20](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TUDAF53UJ-F04AEG39NTB/image.png)

I was very confused on this question so I just assumed that 4 bits were not enoguh to store 8 directions. I know realize that 4 bit can represent 2 to the fourth which equal to 16 pieces of information and therefore it is not neccesary to add extra bits since 4 bits is enough to store the eight directions

# Question 28

![CB Q28](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TUDAF53UJ-F04AEHFPR0R/image.png)

When answering this question I was not being careful. The answer I chose would make the first 25 units have a cost of $7 and units after that have a price of $5. It should be the other way around so 25 should be multiplied by 5 and the (numUnits-25) should be multiplied by 7. This would make option C the correct answer

# Question 35
 
![CB Q35](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TUDAF53UJ-F049Z10S0Q5/image.png)

I selected B in this question becasue I did not know that the maxPS<-50 line takes priority over the previous box of code and sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. Option A is correct because it has the maxPS<-50 in the beginning which sets maxPS to 50 by default
