# Submission 1 

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | the response did not describe the funcionality of the program in the video |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | includes two program segments that show data being stored - the second code segment shows another list namedanimalList. The response identifies animalList, but animalList is not being used in either code segment. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | does not explain how the code managaes complexity  |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | does not explain how procedure contributes ot overall functionality of the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | does not explain in detail how the algorithm works |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Submission 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows a running program and response gives a good description of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | includes two program code segment,one that shows how data has been stored in wslthis list and one that shows the data in this same list being |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | has a program code segment that includes a list and explains how the list manages complexity |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what each of the segment does |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Submission 3

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | video shows the running of a program- The response describes the function of the program but not its purpose. The response states,"The program aims to determine the winner of a hypothetical fight between two Marvel characters, based on which character has the higher average in six categories.‚Äù This did not
satisfy a criteria for this row.|
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | has two program segments one showing data being stored and another in  list |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | has a program code segment that includes a list and explains how the list manages complexity |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what each of the segment do |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Submission 4

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows the running of a program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | has two program segments one showing data being stored and another in  list - second code segment, data stored in the list is not being used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | does not show thorough engough complexity in the code segment |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what each of the segment do |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 0 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure - The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure.|

# Summary

Overall I think I did a good job scoring the exampe submissions. I did get alittle bit better at grading the third row whihc is about managing complexity. I think all 4 examples were quite good, with the second one being very good, I will use that as a guide when making my own project. I definitely find myself getting better at grading these and it hopefully translate to me performing better on my performance task.
