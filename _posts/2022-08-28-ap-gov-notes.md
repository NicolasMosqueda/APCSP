# AP Gov Notes

In my AP Gov class we went over the current events project that will be going on throughout the tirmester. We started by looking at examples from two fo the AP Gov teachers, Mrs. Dupas and Mr. Coats. I took notes on what their presentations. I also made a response to Mr. Coats presentation providing praise and further insight.

In additon to learning about our current eventsassignment, we also talked a lot about the media. More specifically, how to spot fake news and understanding media biases and roles. In this assignemnt I went over steps I took to figuring out if the particular article was fake news or was reliable.
