# Reflection

Well I do feel as if Night at the Museum was a bit rushed, I do not think I met my full potential and could of had more of my project done to present. Being unfocused in class from time to time and not spending enough time working at home are both contributing factors to not being done with my project on the day of Night at the Museum. While, I did not have my project done, I did make a large effort to get something done as I spent roughly 4 hours working on a javascript sport quiz that displays the score at the end. As a group we also could have perfromed better as 3 of us, including myself, did not have our project done. Despite this, aside form the distractions, we all got along very well and worked well as team as we would always do our best to help eachother out. Overall, the Night at the Museum event was very fun and I enjoyed looking at others work in all the different elective classes. It was very cool to see the creatiity of my peers put on display. Below I will share specific projects that I really liked.
