# HTML Fragments Changing Theme


I changed the "remote theme" in config.yml to "moonwalk", a Jekyll theme. My menu links on top are no longer visible (look at screenshot). For example, the search button and tags button are no longer there. This causes a big problem for users of my website. After seeing this, I went ahead and reverted the theme back to normal.
