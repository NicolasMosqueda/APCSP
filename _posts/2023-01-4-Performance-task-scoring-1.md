# Submission 1 

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | while the video did show a running program it did not include a program function |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | the written response includes two code segments |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | there is a list and they explain why the list is neccessary - it did not properly explain the list according to collegeboard |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what the segment does |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Submission 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | video shows the running of a program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | has two program segments one showing data being stored and another in  list |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 1 | does not show thorough engough complexity in the code segment- it does show proper complexity as the list stores 10,800 items |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The project includes two code segments and identifies what each of the segment do |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | includes a student developed algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | descirbes two different calls for a procedure |

# Summary

Overall I think I did a good job scoring the exampe submissions. I did struggle with grading the 3rd row about managing complexity, so I will make sure to work on that more and make sure I fully understadn how to earn that point. I think both examples were quite good, witht the second one being very good, I will use that as a guide when making my own project.
