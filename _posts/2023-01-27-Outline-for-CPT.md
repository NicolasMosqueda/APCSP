# CollegeBoard Requirements

| Reporting Category | How I will reach the standard |
| Program Purpose and Function | My program will be a quiz that challenges the user and tests theri knowledge about sports |
| Data Abstraction | I will store many questions into a database that will be asked to the user when they take the quiz |
| Managing Complexity | The questions that the user recieves will be randomized so that the user can take the quiz multplie times and get new questions each time |
| Procedural Abstraction | I will develop a procedure which randomizes the questions asked to the user |
| Algorithm Implementation | I will create a algorithm that keeps track of the users score |
| Testing | I will show my programs ability to randomize questions as well as show the users score |



# Video Planning

- my video will show a user takeing the quiz twice and getting different questions on each attempt

- I will intentioanlly get some questions wrong to show the scoring feature of the quiz

- I will show that the user can input their score into a table and compare their scores to other users

# Code Planning

- create a question bank and store them in a database

- create code that will display the users score on the quiz

- create a table where users scores can be saved for others to see
