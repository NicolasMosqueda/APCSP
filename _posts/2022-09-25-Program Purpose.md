# Program Purpose


The overall purpose of our project is to demonstrate our groups ability to collaborate and display our coding knowledge through a fun interactive game. Our plan for our project is to make a game which involes the user to go through an escpe room. The user will be able to go through several scenarios which will all lead to different outcomes. We plan to make the game very interactive and enjoyble for the user. We plan to make our game very complex to fulfill the college board requirements and we will make sure we all understand the code and have the ability to explain it.
