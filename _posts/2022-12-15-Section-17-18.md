# Unit 3 Lesson 17-18

# Notes

problme: description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm. An instance of a problem includes a specific input. One example of this type of problem is a sorting problem.

decision problem: problem with a binary answer (yes or no). An optimization problem is a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem.

An algorithm's efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning.

decidable problem: problems for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs.

undecidable problem: problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer.

# Hack 1

Decidable problems are those that can be solved through the use of an algorithm. An example is determining whether a number is even or odd. Undecidable problems cant be solved with an algorithmic procedure. An example is the halting problem which asks if the program will run forever or halt.

# Hack 2

Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm?

A. 2 x 6 x 8

B. 4^5

</ark>C. (3 x 8)^2</mark>

D. None of the above

E. All of the above

C is the correct answer sicne you have to multiplky the numbers inside of the parantheses then take that value to the power of two

# Hack 3 and 4

Using the data.sort function I was able to more to rewrite the code more efficiently

# Hack 5

By importing permutastions from the itertools I was able to rewrite the code more efficiently

# Reflection

These hacks were a bit challenging at first but with perserverance I was able to understand the concepts which allowed me to perform the hacks well. The presentation was great and I learned a lot from it.
