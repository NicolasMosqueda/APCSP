# Unit 3 Lesson 9 and 11

# Notes

A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.

Procedures can be reffered to as method or function depending on the programing language.

A procedrure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure.

Parameters are input values of a procedure.

Argurments specifcy the values of the parameters when a procedure is called.

If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statments.

If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements

Procedures are that a catch-all term for codes used to identify what was done to or given to a patient

If you have a set of statements in a procedure the statement will go thought the top of the procedure to the bottom in order.

Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose

Parameter: are input values of a procedur

There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements

Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program
