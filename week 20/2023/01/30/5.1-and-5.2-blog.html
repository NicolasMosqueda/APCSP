<p>-Users can use the stats predictor feature to make money through sports betting</p>

<p>-My project is a fun challenege for the user that they can use when they are bored</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-proscons-on-internet-blockers-at-router-and-lack-of-admin-password-on-lab-machines-at-school" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?</h1>

<p>-Pros: Websites that contain harmful or innapropraite informtion cannot be accessed on school campus, which overall, keeps the campus more safe</p>

<p>-Cons: Certain websites are blocked that can potentially be useful to learning. Additionally, the wifi is much slower whihc leads students to use hotspots and vpns to get around the internet blockers.</p>

<p>Concerns I have on the digital divide is that people will become too uncomfortable with human interaction. Bullying is much easier online as people say harmful things online that they would not say in person. Addtionally, people will stay inside on their devices all day long not getting any exercise and living an unhealthy life.</p>
