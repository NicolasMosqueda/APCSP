<p>Overall I think I did a good job scoring the exampe submissions. I did struggle with grading the 3rd row about managing complexity, so I will make sure to work on that more and make sure I fully understadn how to earn that point. I think both examples were quite good, witht the second one being very good, I will use that as a guide when making my own project.</p>
